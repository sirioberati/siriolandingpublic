                  The influence of your custom LoRA model is lighter. The AI-generated portrait will have some 
                  features of your custom model, like maybe your hairstyle or facial shape, but it won't be a 
                  perfect match.

                  Your model's influence is at standard strength. The portrait will closely resemble the features 
                  and style you trained the model onâ€”essentially capturing your likeness as intended. This means 
                  the AI uses your model fully to create a portrait that looks exactly like you, based on the 
                  data you provided.

                  The influence of your custom model becomes even stronger. The portrait will emphasize your unique 
                  features more dramatically. This could exaggerate certain characteristics, making the portrait 
                  more stylized or artistic, highlighting details like expressions or specific facial features 
                  even more than you trained for.

                The scale is like a dial that lets you control how much of your custom LoRA model's influence 
                you want in your AI-generated portrait. A higher scale makes the portrait look more like you, 
                based on the model you trained, while a lower scale keeps it closer to the original style.

                Experiment with the weight of the LoRA. For me, I use 1.2 or 1.3 to achieve great results. 
                This sweet spot enhances your unique features while maintaining natural-looking results.
